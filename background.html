							<h2>Who Was Henry David Thoreau?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Henry David Thoreau was born on July 12, 1817 in Concord, Massachuetts. Living in a period of great change in the newly formed United States of America, he became a well known philosopher, writer, and naturalist. He is best known for his book <i>Walden</i>.</p>

						<h3>Early Life</h3>
						<p>Thoreau grew up modestly in Concord, a small town of about 2,000 outside of Boston, where he lived most of his life. He graduated from Harvard University with a scholarship in 1837. He worked as a teacher for a while before deciding to become a poet. He wrote while working as a surveyor, in his parent's pencil-making factory, and at other odd jobs on the side.</p>

						<h3>Transcendentalist Influence</h3>
						<p>In Concord, he became good friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson, an esteemed American philosopher. He became associated with the Transcendentalism movement, a group of intellectuals concerned with high moral views, individualism, and the natural world. He also became friends with other Transcendentalists such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Bronson Alcott, and Margaret Fuller. Feeling inadequate to be a poet, he then transitioned into writing philosophy and literary essays.</p>

						<h3>Further Background</h3>
						<p>In 1843, Emerson got him a tutoring job in Staten Island in an attempt to get into the New York City literary market. The plan failed, but it was not the fault of Emerson. Most of the time, Thoreau lived at home. At one point he built a cabin at Walden Pond, where he lived from 1845 to 1846 and wrote his book Walden. After spending a night in jail for not paying his taxes as a protest against the Mexican-American War, he wrote "Civil Disobedience" in 1849, another highly popular literary essay. As he moved later in life, he spent more time with nature, writing more about botany than philosophy in his journal. He frequently travel, going to places like Maine, Cape Cod, Quebec, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. In the 1850s, he had to make concessions to illness until he was unable to leave his house. He died of tuberculosis on May 6, 1862. In his eulogy, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "His soul was made for the noblest society."</p>
						
						<h3>Literay Works</h3>
						<p>Thoreau's writing, much of it published after his death, was not particularly popular during his time. He wrote many nature essays, such as "Natural History of Massachusetts" (1842), as well as <i>The Maine Woods</i> (1864), <i>Cape Cod</i> (1865), and <i>A Yankee in Canada</i> (1866), which can be classified as travel books. When his brother, John, died of tetanus while suffering from tuberculosis in 1854, Thoreau wrote <i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i> (1849). It included parts of his journal as well as bits of poetry and some philosophizing. His most famous work, <i>Walden</i> (1854), is a sort of how-to book on how to live with a minimum of distasteful labor. It is his spiritual, philosophical autobiography. Facilitated by his sister, Sophia, many of his journals were published after his death. </p>
